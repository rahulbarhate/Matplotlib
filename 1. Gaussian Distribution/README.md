#Draw random samples from a Normal (Gaussian) Distribution.


The probability density for the Gaussian distribution is

where \mu is the mean and \sigma the standard deviation. The square of the standard deviation, \sigma^2, is called the variance.


In this particular code:
1. We have radomly generated 1000 numbers with a mean = 0  and standard deviation = 0.1.
2. Verified the mean and the variance.
3. Displayed the histogram of the samples, along with the probability density function.
